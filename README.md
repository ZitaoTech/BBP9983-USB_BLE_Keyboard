2. enter layer 3 and press the dollar key(left to the enter key).  
3. then your computer can find a storage device called NICENANO.  
4. drag the new firmware(.uf2 file) into the storage device and it's OK.  
PS:If there is an error showing from your computer after you drag the new .uf2 file, don't worry just ignore it.
