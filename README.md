## <a name='Concept of Layer   '>Concept of Layer
Because of the limited number of keys on this tiny keyboard, there are many normal keys like characters or symbols and media keys that we want the keyboard to type out. By default I have set 3 layers on this keyboard, by pressing the layer toggle keys we can enter and exit the layer, at the same time the backlight under the 4 big button keys work as indicator for the current layer number. You can find more Information about it under [Backlight/LED control  ](#-backlightled-control---)
When we power the keyboard on, we are at Layer 1: the QWERTY layer. By pressing the sym key on the right under area, we can enter Layer 2: now we can type out symbol and number like # 1 2 3 which is originally marked on the keyboard. The Layer3 contains some Bluetooth operation keys and other symbols.

## <a name='Multidevice connect  '>Multidevice connect   </a>  
The keyboard can be paired with up to 4 devices and can be switch between them very quickly.  
Here are a few steps showing how you connect the keyboard with a new device when you have already paired with a first device:  
1. Enter Layer 3 by pressing the aA key on the right under area and you can see the backlight under the pannel for the 4 big buttons starts to breath.
2. Press the second or third or fourth big button key dependen on which number you want the keyboard to remember.

4. Operate on you device to pair with the keyboard
5. If you want to switch to another device, enter layer 3 and press the big button that is match with your early operation, **don't double tap the trackpad this time.**

**Out of range problem**:  
Assume that the keyboard is connected with 2 devices：device 1 and device 2. If you turn on the keyboard, the keyboard will first connect with device1.  
And now you put the device 1 out of the communication range of the keyboard, then the keyboard will look for the device that is already paired, that would be the device 2 and stay connected with it.  
If you put device 1 back into the communication range, the keyboard will still stay connected with device 2, if you want to type with device 1, you need reboot the keyboard or enter layer 3 and select BT device 1.  

## <a name='How to delete the pairing  '>How to delete the pairing   </a>  
If you don't want the keyboard to connect with some device that you paired before, here are a few steps that you should do to delete the pairing:  
1. On the keyboard side: switch to the device that you want to delete by entering layer 3 and press the right big button.
2. Go to the Bluetooth setting page of the device and delete the Bluetooth pairing with the keyboard.
3. Now on the keyboard side: Enter Layer 3 and double tap the trackpad to delete the pairing information that is stored in the keyboard.  
**In brief, if you want to delete the pairing, make sure to operate on both sides that the pairing information is deleted.**

## <a name='USB&BLE Output select  '>USB&BLE Output select   </a>
This keyboard supportes both USB and BLE output, here are some basic logics of the output select:  

By default, output is sent to BLE when both USB and BLE are connected.  

If the keyboard wasn't connected to any device or is out of the communication distance with a paired device, the output would be USB.  

Once you toggle the output between USB and BLE by entering layer 3 and hold space key for more than a half second. The keyboard will remember this if you don't make any change for more than 1 seconds.

## <a name='Backlight/LED control  '> Backlight/LED control   </a>
There are 4 LED controls on this keyboard:  
**1. Charging LED**: the read led on the left side of the keyboard indicates if the battery of the keyboard is fully charged. When the battery is being charged, the light shows like this. When the battery is fully charged, the led will go out.  
**2. Side Keyboard backlight**: When you power the keyboard on, the backlight of the Left and Right side of the keyboard area will be turned on immediately. If the keyboard doesn't detect any key press for more than 30 seconds, the whole keyboard backlight will be turned off. Also the brightness of the backlight can be manuelly set. You can find the related action on layer 3. The brightness of the keyboard backlight is set at 40% by default. The brightness adjustment step  in percent is 10%.  
**3. Middle Keyboard backlight**: The backlight of the middle area of the keyboard works as indicator of the current number of layer. At Layer 2, the backlight will start blinking. At Layer3, the backlight will start breathing. The two GIFs will show you the animation of the middle keyboard backlight.  
**Layer2 effect**:![layer2effect](https://github.com/ZitaoTech/BBP9983-USB_BLE_Keyboard/blob/main/Pics/Layer2_effect.gif)  
**Layer3 effect**:![layer3effect](https://github.com/ZitaoTech/BBP9983-USB_BLE_Keyboard/blob/main/Pics/Layer3_effect.gif)  
**4. Trackpad backlight**: The backlight of the trackpad works as indicator of capslock. When capslock is on, the backlight will be turned on and also the trackpad will work as scroll wheel. You can now sweep your finger on the trackpad to quickly browse a webpage or file.

**I have paired successfully with my device, but I can't type anything and there is no mouse movement, what's wrong?**  
Maybe you toggled the USB/BLE output by mistake, Enter layer 3, press and hold space key for more than 500ms and check if you can type now.

First check the bluetooth version of your device, make sure it is 5.0 or higher. 
If you paired the device with the keyboard before, make sure that on the keyboard side the early pairing information is deleted by entering layer 3 and double tap the trackpad.

**(rarely on windows computer) On the Bluetooth setting page of the device the keyboard stays between connected and paired. What's wrong?**  
Something went wrong in the windows system, try to restart the computer, if that not works, delete the pairing from both sides and make the pairing again.
